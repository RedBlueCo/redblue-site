  <h2>What It Is</h2>
  <p>RedBlue allows content producers to create “hypervideo” (interactive online video), such as choose-your-own-story films.</p>
  <p>This is achieved by annotating videos with time-based links and <abbr>UI</abbr> using our open standard, <a href="https://hypervideo.tech/"><abbr>HVML</abbr></a> (Hypervideo Markup Language).</p>
  <p>Hypervideo provides a more immersive experience than regular video, offering higher audience engagement rates, more rewatchability, better brand recall with ads, and a unique selling point for filmmakers.</p>

<section id="why-redblue">
  <h2>Why “RedBlue”?</h2>
  <p>Namesake is the red pill/blue pill option that Morpheus gives Neo in <cite>The Matrix</cite>. Neo is faced with a decision that creates a branching point in the story. We know which option he took in the film, but what if he took the other? What would the rest of the film look like? With RedBlue, all potential storylines can be canonical.</p>
