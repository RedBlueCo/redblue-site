        <h2>What It Is</h2>
        <p>RedBlue allows filmmakers and brands to annotate videos with links or supplemental content to create immersive stories.</p>
        
        <div class="text-center">
          <p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://redbluevideo.github.io/redblue/www/" target="_blank">Launch Prototype</a></p>
          <p>(requires the latest version of Google Chrome)</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Functionality</h2>
        <h3>For new or existing videos:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Branded video player</li>
          <li>Link to external webpages</li>
          <li>Link internally to other videos that load within the same player</li>
          <li>In-video CTAs such as donation, newsletter signup, polling, etc.</li>
          <li>Tag people, products, music, and locations that occur within the video</li>
          <li>Add menus and chapters à la DVD/Blu-ray</li>
          <li>Pop-up video: information boxes with trivia, commentary, etc.</li>
          <li>Contextualization: display explanatory content (e.g. a Wikipedia article) in a sidebar</li>
          <li>Your choice of video hosting: YouTube, Vimeo, or self-hosted. (The actual interactive player would have to be on your own website though.)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For new videos only</h3>
        <p class="text-center">(has to be planned for at the content production stage)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“Choose Your Own Story” (CYOS): stories with multiple timelines and alternate endings</li>
          <li>Switching between alternate synchronized video streams at-will</li>
          <li>Anything else with heavy reliance on user input</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Availability</h2>
        <p>As the software is only in the prototype phase, any of these features would have to be custom-built for a fee. Would work on Desktop and Mobile. Could also do a “Couch Mode” where the video is played back on a Chromecast or Google Cast–enabled Smart TV, with clickable interactive elements appearing on a smartphone.</p>
        <p>In addition to software development, can consult on all aspects of interactive video production: ideation, writing, directing, producing, and editing.</p>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>RedBlue was founded and is operated by <a href="https://hughguiney.com">Hugh Guiney</a> (hello@hughguiney.com), who documents his experience building a startup on his vlog, posted to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/HughGuiney">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HughsVlog/">Facebook</a>.</p>
        <h3>Why “RedBlue”?</h3>
        <p>Namesake is based on the red pill/blue pill option that Morpheus gives Neo in <cite>The Matrix</cite>. Neo is faced with a decision that creates a branching point in the story. We know which option he took in the film, but what if he took the other? What would the rest of the film look like? With RedBlue, all potential storylines can be canonical.</p>
        <h2>Status</h2>
        <p>RedBlue is currently seeking early adopter brand clients, and/or pre-seed funding, to develop a minimum viable product to bring to market.</p>
